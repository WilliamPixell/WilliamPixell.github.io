	<h2> About me </h2>
	<p>I am Xiaopeng Li, a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.ieor.columbia.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Columbia IEOR</a>. 
		My research interest lies in continuous optimization, differential equations, semi-algebraic geometry and deep learning theory. 
		I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. CÃ©dric Josz. Prior to Columbia, I received my Bachelor of Science 
		in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CUHK(SZ)</a>.</p>
